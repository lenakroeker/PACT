PACT DEVELOPMENT SKILLS EVALUATION

During development, I encountered challenges with the product carousel's responsiveness. Initially, button opacities failed to update correctly during scrolling, leading to inconsistencies across screen sizes. After debugging, I refined the calculation method to adjust opacities accurately based on scroll position.

Additionally, ensuring visual coherence and intuitive design across various media widths proved challenging. Leveraging responsive design principles and CSS media queries, I meticulously adjusted spacing, typography, and color schemes to maintain consistency and usability on all devices. While striving to adhere to the original design, I made slight alterations to enhance interactivity, such as adjusting the opacity of product tags on hover, adding depth to the user experience.
